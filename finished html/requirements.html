    <h1>Requirements</h1><br>

    <h2>Pets should be well behaved</h2>
    <p>Pets that show aggressive behavior may pose a risk to the groomer and other pets in the salon. For everyone’s safety, <br>pets must be calm enough to be handled without causing harm.
    <h2>Pets should'nt be evidently sick</h2>
    <p>If a pet appears unwell—such as having pale gums, low energy, or unusual behavior—it may need medical attention instead of grooming. <br>Grooming a sick pet can worsen its condition.</p>
    <h2>Pets should'nt have ticks and fleas</h2>
    <p>Pets with heavy tick or flea infestations cannot be groomed because parasites may spread to other pets and areas of the salon. <br>These pets should first receive proper parasite treatment.</p>
    <h2>With large infected wounds</h2>
    <p>Open or infected wounds can be painful for pets and may worsen during grooming. These injuries need veterinary care before the pet <br>can safely undergo grooming services</p>
    <h2>Incomplete vaccines</h2>
    <p>Vaccinations protect both pets and staff from contagious diseases. For health and safety reasons, pets must be up-to-date with their essential shots before being accepted.</p><br>
    <h1>Assessment Before Grooming</h1>
    <p>*We reserve the right to assess your pet first prior to grooming to ensure safety of both groomer and your fur baby</p><br>
    <h2>Note: If the groomer was bitten by your pet, you will cover all the medical expenses needed</h2><br><br>
